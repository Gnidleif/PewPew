Hello and welcome to the awesome world of this game!
I've not decided what this game's going to become yet, which is why I'm mostly focusing on the engine
using cool techniques I've not used before.
So far I have:
* Entity Component System
  This is really cool. I have a feeling the components and their systems will be a constant work in progress however.
  Might implement some cool .xml stuff later instead of the quite ugly EntityFactory that I have now.
* Basic collisions
* Image rendering
* Shape rendering
* Moving entities
* Fixed time game loop
  An update call without deltatime? And it works awesomely? So cool!
  This will have it's uses later when I'm starting to implement physics and stuff.

Coming soon:
* Pixel perfect collision
  Will be using quad trees and boundingboxes and whatnot. Looking forward to doing this.

Coming very soon:
* Network stuff 
  I fucking hate networks at the moment though.
